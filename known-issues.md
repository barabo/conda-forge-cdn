# Conda Forge CDN Known Issues
- [ ] `index.html` has wrong mime-type - is downloaded instead of displayed
- [ ] `last-updated` in not being updated after each sync
    - [ ] This causes the conda forge status page to claim cloning is down (it isn't)
- [ ] RSS feed is (still) broken
    - [x] this is harmless, since it's been like this for over a year :grimacing: - but it's still something we want to fix anyway
